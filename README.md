# MLDS Week 1 - Data Collection and Processing

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git

### Local Development Setup

**Important:** This project requires a virtual environment to manage dependencies and ensure consistency across different machines.

#### Option 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)

**For Windows:**
```bash
setup.bat
```
This script will:
- Create a virtual environment in the `venv` folder
- Activate the virtual environment
- Install all required dependencies from `requirements.txt`

**For Linux/Mac:**
```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

#### Option 2: Manual Setup

1. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
   This creates a new folder called `venv` in your project directory containing an isolated Python environment.

2. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   
   **On Windows (PowerShell):**
   ```bash
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
   
   **On Windows (Command Prompt):**
   ```bash
   venv\Scripts\activate.bat
   ```
   
   **On Linux/Mac:**
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
   
   You'll know it's activated when you see `(venv)` at the beginning of your command prompt.

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

#### Deactivating the Virtual Environment

When you're done working on the project:
```bash
deactivate
```

### Running the Project

**Always activate your virtual environment before running code or tests!**

#### Running Individual Tasks

```bash
# Activate venv first
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On Linux/Mac:
source venv/bin/activate

# Run a specific task
python src/task1_scrape.py
python src/task2_fetch_tokyo_weather.py
# ... etc
```

#### Running Tests

```bash
# Activate virtual environment first, then:
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test file:
python -m pytest tests/test_task1_scrape.py -v

# Run with coverage:
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=html
```

### Visualizing Results with Streamlit Dashboard

After completing the tasks, you can visualize all results using the interactive Streamlit dashboard:

```bash
# Activate virtual environment first, then:
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

The dashboard will open in your browser and display:
- 📰 **Task 1:** Web scraping results from Wikipedia
- 🌐 **Task 2:** API data collection with temperature gauges
- 🌦️ **Task 3:** Complex weather analysis with interactive charts
- 📁 **Task 4:** CSV export data with downloadable files
- 📄 **Task 5:** XML parsing results and visualizations
- 🔍 **Task 6:** Regex extraction analysis

**Dashboard Features:**
- Interactive charts and graphs using Plotly
- Real-time data loading from generated files
- Task completion status overview
- Downloadable processed data
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

### Troubleshooting

**Issue: "Module not found" errors**
- Solution: Make sure your virtual environment is activated and dependencies are installed

**Issue: Scripts won't run on Windows (execution policy error)**
- Solution: Run PowerShell as Administrator and execute:
  ```powershell
  Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
  ```

**Issue: Import errors between modules**
- Solution: Run Python with the `-m` flag from the project root:
  ```bash
  python -m pytest tests/
  ```

**Issue: Streamlit shows "No data found" warnings**
- Solution: Run the corresponding task script first to generate the data files:
  ```bash
  python src/task1_scrape.py
  python src/task2_fetch_tokyo_weather.py
  # ... etc
  ```

## Task 1. Basic Web Scraping and JSON Storage

Create a Python script that performs basic web scraping on a Wikipedia page to extract specific information and then saves this information in a JSON file.

**Tasks:**

1. **Fetch a Wikipedia Page:**
   - Write a Python function that retrieves the HTML content of the Wikipedia page for "Web scraping" using the `requests` library.

2. **Extract the Page Title:**
   - Write a Python function that parses the HTML content using `BeautifulSoup` and extracts the title of the page (`<h1>` element with `id="firstHeading"`).

3. **Extract the First Sentence of the First Paragraph:**
   - Write a Python function that extracts the first sentence from the first paragraph (`<p>` element) on the page.

4. **Store the Extracted Information in a JSON File:**
   - Write a Python function that saves the extracted title and first sentence into a JSON file.

**Expected JSON Output:**

The JSON file should contain the following structure:

```json
{
    "title": "Web scraping",
    "first_sentence": "Web scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction is data scraping used for extracting data from websites."
}
```

**Implementation Details:**

- **Libraries Used:** `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `json`, `pytest`
- **Common Utilities:** Shared functions (`load_json`, `save_to_json`) are available in `src/utils.py`
- **Testing:** Use `pytest` to implement unit tests for each function.
- **File Handling:** The extracted data should be saved to a JSON file named `extracted_wikipedia_data.json`.



## Task 2: Collecting Weather Data Using Open-Meteo API

Learn how to collect weather data using the Open-Meteo API and save the extracted data into a JSON file.

### Task Description:

1. **Fetch Weather Data:**
   - Write a Python script that sends a request to the Open-Meteo API using the provided endpoint:
     - URL: `https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=35.6895&longitude=139.6917&daily=temperature_2m_max&timezone=Asia/Tokyo`
   - This URL fetches the maximum temperature forecast for Tokyo (latitude 35.6895, longitude 139.6917).

2. **Extract the Maximum Temperature:**
   - Extract the `temperature_2m_max` value from the JSON response. This represents the maximum temperature for the next day in Tokyo.

3. **Save the Extracted Data:**
   - Save the extracted temperature data into a JSON file named `tokyo_weather.json`.

### JSON Output Example:

The JSON file might look like this:

```json
{
    "date": "2024-08-18",
    "max_temperature": 32.5
}
```

## Task 3: Advanced Parsing, Analyzing, and Reporting on Complex Weather Data

     - Daily weather data, including the date, maximum and minimum temperatures, precipitation, wind speed, humidity, and a short weather description.

3. **Perform Multiple Analyses:**
   - **Temperature Analysis:** For each day, check if the maximum temperature exceeds a specified threshold (e.g., 30°C) and determine if it’s a hot day.
   - **Temperature Swing Analysis:** Calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum temperatures for each day. Determine if there was a significant temperature swing (e.g., more than 10°C).
   - **Wind Analysis:** Check if the wind speed exceeded a specified threshold (e.g., 15 km/h) and determine if it was a windy day.
   - **Humidity and Comfort Analysis:** Assess the humidity level and determine if the day was likely to be uncomfortable (e.g., if humidity is over 70%).
   - **Precipitation Analysis:** Identify rainy days and determine the severity of the rain (e.g., light, moderate, or heavy rain based on precipitation levels).

4. **Generate Detailed Reports:**
   - For each day, generate a detailed report that summarizes the findings from the analyses. The report should include:
     - The date and weather description.
     - An assessment of whether it was a hot day, the significance of the temperature swing, whether it was windy, and whether the humidity made the day uncomfortable.
     - Information on whether it was a rainy day or if there was no precipitation.
   - Provide a summary report that highlights:
     - The hottest day.
     - The windiest day.
     - The most humid day.
     - The day with the most precipitation.
